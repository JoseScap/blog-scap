## Introduction

Can we avoid testing? I think no. So, in this blog we'll learn, how to implement Jest in our node-express applications and understand the main testing concepts.

## What testing is

Software testing is a fundamental process to verify our development. Our apps have the right behavior and they go well in different cases, including edge cases? That's why we need to test software, to achieve the quality assurance.

### Different testing kinds

When you are building apps, there will be different kind of testing. You could implement some of them to get higher quality for your apps.

In this section we'll name the most fundamentals and simple to integrate if you're a developer.

1. Unit testing: Unit tests are smaller and simpler to learn and they'll be our start point. With these kind of tests, we can verify small functions and little pieces of code. With them we can see if everything in this functions it's going well, and if we code new features we can see if some of these last functions is now broken. 
2. Integration testing: These kind of, it's a little bit different. As its name suggest these are integrations, but of what, integrations of smaller functionalities. We won't be testing smaller functions forever, after write our unit tests we need to see if our smaller functions works well together. A simple example of this situations are controllers in our servers, because they are integrations of other functionalities.

Each type of test has its own purpose and focus area. The combination of these test types helps identify and correct issues at different levels of software development, allowing for an improvement in the quality of the final product.

It is important to note that there are other types of tests in software development, such as regression tests, performance tests, security tests, among others, which also play specific roles in the validation and verification of the software.

## Testing with Jest and its setup

Jest is a popular testing framework for JavaScript, primarily designed for unit testing, although it can also be used for integration testing in Node.js applications and frontend development with frameworks such as React, Vue.js, Angular, among others.

The first thing we will do to use Jest is to install its corresponding dependencies.

```shell
npm install -D jest eslint
```

Following this, we configure its main file called `jest.config.js`.

```javascript
const jestConfig = {
    testEnvironment: 'node'
}

module.exports = jestConfig
```

And also we need to configure eslint to work with jest and setup our testing environment using the `.eslintrc.js` file. The code below is a simple config for eslint.

```javascript
module.exports = {
    'env': {
        'commonjs': true,
        'es2021': true,
        'node': true,
        'jest/globals': true
    },
    'extends': 'eslint:recommended',
    'parserOptions': {
        'ecmaVersion': 'latest'
    },
    'rules': {
        'indent': [
            'error',
            4
        ],
        'linebreak-style': [
            'error',
            'windows'
        ],
        'quotes': [
            'error',
            'single'
        ],
        'semi': [
            'error',
            'never'
        ]
    }
}
```

And we finish by implementing Jest in the scripts of our `package.json` file.

```json
{
    // ...
    "scripts": {
        "test": "jest",
        "test:watch": "jest --watch",
        "test:coverage": "jest --coverage"
    }
    // ...
}
```

### Preparing to write our first tests

Now we are ready test some functions, before to start, first thing we'll do is write a file that will be name `math.utils.js` and its code will be the next:

```javascript
// math.utils.js

const sum = (a, b) => a + b
const subtraction = (a, b) => a - b
const multiplication = (a, b) => a * b
const division = (a, b) => a / b
const calculator = (a, b, operation) => operation(a, b)

module.exports = {
    sum,
    subtraction,
    multiplication,
    division,
    calculator
}
```

After having code to test, the next action is to select our testing folder structure. Below there will be two examples to use in your project.

1. Test folder as **a mirror** of source folder

```
└── 📁Project
    └── ...
    └── 📁src
        └── 📁utils
            └── math.utils.js
    └── 📁test
        └── 📁utils
            └── math.utils.spec.js
```

2. Testing files **next to** each file to test

```
└── 📁Project
    └── ...
    └── 📁src
        └── 📁utils
            └── math.utils.js
            └── math.utils.spec.js
```

### Testing `sum` function

The next code is the simpler structure to write a test. As we can see, it's just function that only receive two arguments (descriptive text and callback test).

```javascript
test('Description of our test', () => {})
```

1. **First argument:** It's just text to describe what we are verifying.
2. **Second argument:** It's the callback to execute, everything will be fine if no error is thrown.

Example: Testing `sum`

```javascript
const {
    sum,
} = require("../../src/utils/math.utils")

test('sum should return 3 when 2 + 1', () => {
    expect(sum(2, 1)).toBe(3)
})
```

AS we can see, **expect** it's a function that we'll use to verify what we are expecting in our features or functions.

```javascript
// More tests here below

test('sum should return 16 when (2 * 4) + (2 ^ 3)', () => {
    expect(sum(2 * 4, 2 ** 3)).toBe(16)
})
```

Everything is going well but there's one problem, What happen if one or both arguments of sum function is an string? Technically for javascript there are no errors, because `sum` function can concatenate strings using `+` operator, but for Maths that has no sense.

So, the question now it's the following, can we test errors? Yes, of course, let's make some changes in our code.

```javascript
// math.utils.js
const sum = (a, b) => {
    if (typeof a !== "number" || typeof b !== "number") throw new Error("Arguments are not numbers")

    return a + b
}

// math.utils.spec.js
test('sum should return an error when both arguments are strings', () => {
    expect(() => sum("Hello ", "Jose")).toThrow()
})

test('sum should return an error when a string is an argument', () => {
    expect(() => sum("Hello ", 100)).toThrow()
})
```

When we want to test if a function throws an error, inside expect function we need to pass a callback as argument, please don't pass the result of a function because error won't be catch.

### Grouping testing into `describe`

Now maybe we have a something like next example

```javascript
const {
    sum,
} = require("../../src/utils/math.utils")

test('sum should return 3 when 2 + 1', () => {
    expect(sum(2, 1)).toBe(3)
})

test('sum should return 16 when (2 * 4) + (2 ^ 3)', () => {
    expect(sum(2 * 4, 2 ** 3)).toBe(16)
})

test('sum should return an error when a string is an argument', () => {
    expect(() => sum("Hello ", "Jose")).toThrow()
})

test('sum should return an error when a string is an argument', () => {
    expect(() => sum("Hello ", 100)).toThrow()
})
```
Everything looks well, but there's one problem, What happen if we want to test new features without confusions?. A simple example is to test `subtraction`, `multiplication` and `division`. How can we distinguish what it's testing each test faster? The solution is to group each in into `describe` function.

```javascript
const {
    sum,
} = require("../../src/utils/math.utils")

describe("Sum function", () => {
    // Here you can put all tests just about `sum` function
})
```
