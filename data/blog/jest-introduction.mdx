## Introduction

Can we avoid testing? I don't think so. In this blog, we'll learn how to implement Jest in our Node.js Express applications and understand the main testing concepts.

## What testing is

Software testing is a fundamental process to verify our development. Do our apps exhibit the right behavior and perform well in different cases, including edge cases! That's why we need to test software—to achieve quality assurance.

### Different testing kinds

When you are building apps, there will be different kinds of testing. You could implement some of them to achieve higher quality for your apps.

In this section, we'll name the most fundamental and simple ones to integrate if you're a developer.

1. Unit testing: Unit tests are smaller and simpler to learn, and they will be our starting point. With these kinds of tests, we can verify small functions and little pieces of code. Using them, we can check if everything in these functions is going well. When coding new features, we can also see if any of these last functions are now broken.
2. Integration testing: This type is a little bit different. As its name suggests, these are integrations, but of what? Integrations of smaller functionalities. We won't be testing smaller functions forever; after writing our unit tests, we need to see if our smaller functions work well together. A simple example of this situation is controllers in our servers because they are integrations of other functionalities.

It is important to note that there are other types of tests in software development, such as regression tests, performance tests, security tests, among others, which also play specific roles in the validation and verification of the software.

## Testing with Jest and its setup

Jest is a popular testing framework for JavaScript, primarily designed for unit testing, although it can also be used for integration testing in Node.js applications and frontend development with frameworks such as React, Vue.js, Angular, among others.

The first thing we will do to use Jest is to install its corresponding dependencies.

```shell
npm install -D jest @types/jest eslint eslint-plugin-jest
```

Following this, we configure its main file called `jest.config.js.` This configuration file allows us to customize Jest settings according to the specific needs of our project.

```javascript
const jestConfig = {
    testEnvironment: 'node'
}

module.exports = jestConfig
```

And also, we need to configure ESLint to work with Jest and set up our testing environment using the `.eslintrc.js` file. The code below provides a simple configuration for ESLint.

```javascript
module.exports = {
    'env': {
        'commonjs': true,
        'es2021': true,
        'node': true,
        'jest/globals': true
    },
    'plugins': ['jest'],
    'extends': 'eslint:recommended',
    'parserOptions': {
        'ecmaVersion': 'latest'
    },
    'rules': {
        'indent': [
            'error',
            4
        ],
        'linebreak-style': [
            'error',
            'windows'
        ],
        'quotes': [
            'error',
            'single'
        ],
        'semi': [
            'error',
            'never'
        ]
    }
}

```

And we finish by implementing Jest in the scripts section of our package.json file.

```json
{
    // ...
    "scripts": {
        "test": "jest",
        "test:watch": "jest --watch",
        "test:coverage": "jest --coverage"
    },
    // ...
}
```

### Preparing to write our first tests

Now we are ready to test some functions. Before we start, the first thing we'll do is write a file named `math.utils.js`, and its code will be as follows:

```javascript
// math.utils.js

const sum = (a, b) => a + b
const subtraction = (a, b) => a - b
const multiplication = (a, b) => a * b
const division = (a, b) => a / b

module.exports = {
    sum,
    subtraction,
    multiplication,
    division
}
```

After having code to test, the next action is to select our testing folder structure. Below, there will be two examples to use in your project.

1. Test folder as **a mirror** of the source folder.

```
└── 📁Project
    └── ...
    └── 📁src
        └── 📁utils
            └── math.utils.js
    └── 📁test
        └── 📁utils
            └── math.utils.spec.js
```

2. Testing files **next to** each file to be tested

```
└── 📁Project
    └── ...
    └── 📁src
        └── 📁utils
            └── math.utils.js
            └── math.utils.spec.js
```

### Testing `sum` function

The next code is the simplest structure to write a test. As we can see, it's just a function that receives only two arguments (descriptive text and test callback).

```javascript
test('Description of our test', () => {})
```

1. **First argument:** This is simply text used to describe what we are verifying.
2. **Second argument:** It's the callback to execute; everything will be fine if no error is thrown.

Example: Testing `sum`

```javascript
const {
    sum,
} = require("../../src/utils/math.utils")

test('sum should return 3 when 2 + 1', () => {
    expect(sum(2, 1)).toBe(3)
})
```

As we can see, expect is a function that we'll use to verify what we are expecting in our features or functions.

```javascript
// More tests here below

test('sum should return 16 when (2 * 4) + (2 ^ 3)', () => {
    expect(sum(2 * 4, 2 ** 3)).toBe(16)
})
```

Everything is going well, but there's one problem: What happens if one or both arguments of the `sum` function are strings? Technically, for JavaScript, there are no errors, because the `sum` function can concatenate strings using the `+` operator, but for mathematics, that makes no sense.

So, the question now is the following: can we test errors? Yes, of course, let's make some changes in our code.

```javascript
// math.utils.js
const sum = (a, b) => {
    if (typeof a !== "number" || typeof b !== "number") throw new Error("Arguments are not numbers")

    return a + b
}

// math.utils.spec.js
test('sum should return an error when both arguments are strings', () => {
    expect(() => sum("Hello ", "Jose")).toThrow()
})

test('sum should return an error when a string is an argument', () => {
    expect(() => sum("Hello ", 100)).toThrow()
})
```

When we want to test if a function throws an error, inside the `expect` function, we need to pass a callback as an argument. Please don't pass the result of a function because the error won't be caught.

### Grouping testing into `describe`

Now we may have something like the following example.

```javascript
const {
    sum,
} = require("../../src/utils/math.utils")

test('sum should return 3 when 2 + 1', () => {
    expect(sum(2, 1)).toBe(3)
})

test('sum should return 16 when (2 * 4) + (2 ^ 3)', () => {
    expect(sum(2 * 4, 2 ** 3)).toBe(16)
})

test('sum should return an error when a string is an argument', () => {
    expect(() => sum("Hello ", "Jose")).toThrow()
})

test('sum should return an error when a string is an argument', () => {
    expect(() => sum("Hello ", 100)).toThrow()
})
```
Everything looks good, but there's one problem: What happens if we want to test new features without confusion? A simple example is testing `subtraction`, `multiplication`, and `division`. How can we distinguish what each test is testing faster? The solution is to group each into a `describe` function.

```javascript
const {
    sum,
} = require("../../src/utils/math.utils")

describe("Sum function", () => {
    // ... other tests about sum
    
    test('sum should return 3 when 2 + 1', () => {
        expect(sum(2, 1)).toBe(3)
    })

    // ... other tests about sum
})
```

## Summary

We delved into the significance of software testing, with a focus on leveraging Jest, a widely-used testing framework for JavaScript. The process involves configuring Jest, ESLint, and the package.json file for seamless integration. Exploring the structure of writing tests, we highlighted the importance of an organized testing folder and demonstrated the use of the expect function to verify expected outcomes. The example underscored the challenge of testing functions with string arguments and the necessity of error testing. To enhance clarity when testing new features, we recommended grouping tests using the `describe` function.

## Next Chapter

In the upcoming chapter, we'll dive into two crucial aspects of testing: **mocking functions** and testing functions that receive **callbacks as parameters**. Mocking functions allows us to simulate certain behaviors, enabling controlled testing environments. We'll explore how to create mocks and understand their significance in ensuring robust and reliable tests. Additionally, we'll delve into the intricacies of testing functions that take callbacks, addressing unique challenges and providing effective strategies to validate such functionalities. Get ready for an insightful exploration that will enhance your testing skills and empower you to tackle more complex scenarios in your software development journey.
